## Simple Summary

CAIP-69 extends the CAIP-10 address format to include an identifier if the 
given address is an externally owned account (EOA).

## Abstract

This proposal aims to facilitate specifying EOAs as multichain accounts
extending CAIP-10 chain id specification. This is useful for both
decentralized applications to communicate that EOAs can be used for multiple 
chains using a chainID of 0 to specify that the account is an EOA. Currently, 
addresses are usually assigned to only one chain using CAIP-10 and an EOA
would be required to be assigned multiple times for each chain. This proposal 
aims to extend the CAIP-10 standard so EOAs can be designated as an EOA once,
and be treated as an EOA on every applicable chain.


## Motivation

The motivation for proposal stems from the redundancy of assigning an EOA
as living on every chain that exists. As new chains continue to be launched
it becomes more and more obvious that assigning an EOA its own specific
designation will greatly simplify their use in cross chain applications.


## Specification

The blockchain ID will be ammended to contain a new parameter, `eoa_flag`, that will be a boolean (denoted in integers between 0 and 1), such that 0 denotes an EOA, and 1 denotes a non-EOA address.

### Syntax

The `chain_id` string will be ammended as follows:

```
chain_id:    namespace + ":" + eoa_flag + ":" + reference
eoa_flag:    [0-9]{1,1}
namespace:   [-a-z0-9]{3,8}
reference:   [-_a-zA-Z0-9]{1,32}
```

## Rationale

The goals of the EOA designation is:
- Simplify the registration of EOAs in applications
- Avoid changing the standards that exist in any meaningful way.
- Full backwards compatibility for the current CAIP-10 standard users.


## Usage

```
# EOA
eip155:0:0x839395e20bbB182fa440d08F850E6c7A8f6F0780
```

```
# non-EOA
eip155:1:0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F
```

## Security Concerns

We should have users sign a message to prove they have an EOA (Greg to fill out more completely)
